## NodeJS API and Socket.io

Directory: nodejs-socketio

Description: Simple introduction to using NodeJS (express) as an API. Also explores socket.io

Notes: 

 - Follow server1.js through server7.js and server-final.js for an express API example. server-basic.js is an uncommented and refined version of server-final.js intended to provide a 'quick start' to a new project.
 - socket-server1.js coupled with public/client-server.html is a simple example of setting up a socket to show mouse pointer location for x number of people on the page.
